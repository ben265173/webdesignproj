                    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
                    <p>3 beaten eggs, 1 tsp sunflower oil, 1 tsp butter</p>
                    <P><B>Instructions:</B></P>
                    <p>1. Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</p>
                    <p>2. Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</p>
                    <p>3. Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</p>
                    <p>4. At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like – some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well. Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.</p>

                    <img id="recipeimage" src="Images/macandcheese.jpg">
                    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
                    <p>700ml full-fat milk, 350g macaroni, 50g butter, 50g plain flour, 175g grated mature cheddar cheese, 1 tsp English mustard</p>
                    <P><B>Instructions:</B></P>
                    <p>1. In a small pan, warm the milk, until almost boiling. Remove from the heat, leave covered to infuse for 10 mins, then strain. Cook the macaroni according to pack instructions until just soft, but still with a little bite. This will take about 10 mins. Drain in a colander, then run under the tap and stir to stop the pasta sticking together.</p>
                    <p>2. Heat oven to 190C/ fan 170C/gas 5 and butter a 25 x 18cm ovenproof dish. Melt the butter in the medium pan. When foaming, add the flour, then cook, stirring constantly, for 1 min on a low heat.</p>
                    <p>3. Slowly stir the warm infused milk into the roux until smooth. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and has a coating consistency. Remove the pan from the heat, then add the cheddar and mustard powder. Season, then stir until the cheese has melted.</p>
                    <p>Mix the cheesesauce through the macaroni to coat it well, then tip into the prepared dish. Bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown and bubbling</p>

                    <img id="recipeimage" src="Images/spaghettibolegnese.jpg">
                    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
                    <p>2 tbsp olive oil, 400g/14oz beef mince, 1 diced onion, 2 garlic cloves chopped, 100g/3½oz carrot grated, 2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes, 400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do), 400g/14oz dried spaghetti, salt and pepper</p>
                    <P><B>Instructions:</B></P>
                    <p>1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.</p>
                    <p>2. While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.</p>
                    <p>3. Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</p>

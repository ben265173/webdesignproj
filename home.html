                <h2><u>Why was it created?</u></h2>
                <p>This website was created with the thought of new college students being away from home and having to prepare meals for themselves. Many students find themselves away from home and by themselves for the first time and can only survive off pot noodles for so long. Students can sometimes have trouble with cooking as food can be expensive and they might not be used to cooking at home.<br>This website was made in hope to guide these students on easy and affordable meals to prepare them for the future.</p>
